These texts are informal reports written by CRM users, such as sales representatives, describing interactions or tasks — for example: “I talked to the client João this morning. He’s interested in subscribing to our service and scheduled a meeting for this Friday at 10 a.m. His phone number is +55 61 99876-5881 and he’s from São Paulo.” Your goal is to generate, based on this type of description, a natural-language summary in English that clearly and concisely explains which actions will be performed in the CRM according to the provided information. The output must be a single, well-structured, cohesive paragraph."
